XFS is a high-performance 64-bit journaling file system created by Silicon Graphics, Inc (SGI) in 1993.[8] It was the default file system in SGI's IRIX operating system starting with its version 5.3. XFS was ported to the Linux kernel in 2001; as of June 2014, XFS is supported by most Linux distributions, some of which use it as the default file system.
